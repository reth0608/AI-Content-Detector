# AI-Content-Detector
## Project Overview

The **AI-Content Detector** project aims to detect whether a given text is AI-generated or human-written. The project consists of a web-based interface that allows users to input text and checks the content's authenticity using a pre-trained machine learning model on the backend. The interface responds with a "YES" or "NO" based on the prediction.
